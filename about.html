<p>After graduating high school, I started my
    career as a Hair and Makeup Artist. I went
    from being a stylist, to a Salon Owner, to
    a Freelance Celebrity Stylist over a 10
    year span. Some celebrities I've had the
    opportunity to groom/style are: Tia Mowry,
    Orlando Bloom, and Normani from 5th
    Harmony. After acheiving all of my
    childhood dreams,
    I decided to pursue my next love:
    Computer Technology. I received my Comptia A+
    certification in August 2019. I then opened
    my own computer/mobile repair business. Two
    years later, I am now a Software Engineer. I'm
    excited and look forward to where this
    journey will take me. Thank you for your
    interest in my story!
